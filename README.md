Continued from dwm version 6.2



dwm - dynamic window manager
============================
dwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.


Requirements
------------
In order to build dwm you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dwm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dwm (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running dwm
-----------
Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start dwm using startx:

    exec dwm

In order to connect dwm to a specific display, make sure that
the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:

    DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec dwm

(This will start dwm on display :1 of the host foo.bar.)

In order to display status info in the bar, you can do something
like this in your .xinitrc:

    while xsetroot -name "`date` `uptime | sed 's/.*,//'`"
    do
    	sleep 1
    done &
    exec dwm


Configuration
-------------
The configuration of dwm is done by creating a custom config.h
and (re)compiling the source code.


Patches
-------

The file `include_patches.h` contains macros which enable/disable some of the patches. To enable a patch, set the value of corresponding macro to `1`. And similarly to disable, set to `0`.

> Note that there are 10 tags in this dwn fork rather default 9. 10th tag is binded with "0" key.

- [fullgaps](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/fullgaps/) - For showing gaps in dwm 6.2.
- [autostart](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/autostart/) - Autostart applications after startup.
- [systray](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/autostart/) - Showing system tray to hold icons for applications like `nm-applet`.
- [restartsig](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/restartsig/) - Apply changes without quitting dwm.
- [pertag](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/pertag/) - This patch keeps `layout`, `mwfact` and `nmaster` separate for each tag. `barpos` remains same for every tag.
- [bottomstack with ru_gaps](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/ru_gaps/) - Same as tile layout but instead of single columns, new windows are attached in single row below master window. `ru_gaps` adds gaps to it.
- [centeredmaster with ru_gaps](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/ru_gaps/) - Keep master in center and slaves at sides. This is with gaps present between windows. Here is  [original](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/centeredmaster/) without gaps.
- [fullscreen](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/fullscreen/) - Applies the monocle layout with the focused client on top and hides the bar. When pressed again, shows the bar and restores the layout that was active before going fullscreen.
- [hide vacant tags](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/hide_vacant_tags/) - Hide vacant tags :)
- [activetagindicatorbar](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/activetagindicatorbar/) - Show rectangular boxes instead of squares on tags with some windows. This is not so useful when hide-vacant-tags is used and hence currently **inacitve**.
> _Modified patch activetagindicatorbar. Changed bar length and position from top to bottom. Indication is slimmer now ðŸ˜Ž._

After modified activetagindicatorbar:

- [tagswapmon](https://github.com/bakkeby/patches/blob/master/dwm/dwm-tagswapmon-6.2.diff) - Swap tags between two monitors. Bring the important tag present on secondary screen onto primary screen with a single keybinding.
- [holdbar](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/holdbar/) - Shows bar only when `HOLDKEY` is pressed. Some modifications in this patch. When bar is hidden, `holdbar` will be active and when bar is visible (after using `togglebar`), `holdbar` will not work. This is actually the default behavior of the patch when `HOLDKEY` is not `MODKEY`. But now this will work even when `HOLDKEY` is `MODKEY`. See [this](https://github.com/bakkeby/dwm-flexipatch/issues/35) thread.
- [attachaside](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/attachaside/) - Make new clients get attached and focused in the stacking area instead of always becoming the new master.
- [statuscolors](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/statuscolors/) - Add colors to status bar. This patch is currently inactive as it adds some unknown gaps when used with along systray patch. [Here is a reddit discussion regarding same issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/ahoudy/need_help_status_color_patch_on_dwm_a_strange_gap/). Really useful patch if it's working properly.
- [statuscmd](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/statuscmd/) - This patch adds the ability to execute shell commands based on the mouse button and position when clicking the status bar. This patch has been slightly modified as per [suggestion](https://github.com/chhajedji/dwm/commit/10353926c247c68805499e8403815f2efad4bb6e#r47272109) from [@bakkeby](https://github.com/bakkeby). When applied with `systray` patch, a variable needs to be updated to get correct clicked location.
- [pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal) - Set colors according to your wallpaper. This patch is useful when you have a single constant wallpaper. When wallpaper changes frequently, dwm will have to be recompiled to incorporate new colors. See [this](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal/wiki/Customization#dwm) guide for setup.
- [scratchpads](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/scratchpads/) - Add scratchpads similar to i3wm. Useful for handy programs to be kept in scratchpad rather than always launching.
